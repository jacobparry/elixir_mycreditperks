  Keep in mind that your API and the underlying data representations
  do not need to be identical, or even have the same structure.
  One of the main values in modeling GraphQL types is that they
  can serve as an abstraction over whatever backing data store (or
  service) contains the associated data, transforming it before itâ€™s
  transmitted to API users.
